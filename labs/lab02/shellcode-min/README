 Lab02: shellcode-min
=====================

   This problem will prepare you to write a short and concise shellcode
   to make your shellcode more flexible and powerful, perhaps evading
   anomaly-based IDS that drops lengthy requests. Please write a shellcode
   that reads the flag from /proc/flag! But, minimize the size of the
   shellcode as much as you can. 
   
   ; build
   $ ./make.sh
   
   ; run your shellcode
   $ cat readflag.bin | ./target
   
   ; submit your flag
   $ submit -l lab02 -p shellcode-min -f <flag-file>
   
   NOTE. you must get your flag from the ./target binary!
